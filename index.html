        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
        high-level built
        in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
        Application
        Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
        Python's
        simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
        Python
        supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and
        the
        extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and
        can be
        freely distributed.

        MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query
        language
        (SQL).

        A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture
        gallery or a
        place to hold the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. In particular, a relational database is a
        digital
        store collecting data and organizing it according to the relational model. In this model, tables consist of rows
        and
        columns, and relationships between data elements all follow a strict logical structure. An RDBMS is simply the
        set of
        software tools used to actually implement, manage, and query such a database.
